    <br>contributing to <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">the vision to scale Ethereum</a>.

    Before that, I designed for GitHub for 6+ years.
    <br>It was here where I grew up, developed my opinions,
    <br>and became a GitHub maxi.

  I've become deeply committed to <a href="https://www.optimism.io/vision">Optimism's vision</a> of the decentralized future. My most important goal this year is to grow the design function at OP Labs such that I'm the worst designer on the team. Building this design team will be my ongoing contribution in supporting Optimism's progress on solving gnarly problems like public goods funding, identity, and contribution in web3.
